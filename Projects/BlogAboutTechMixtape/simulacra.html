        <p>Its central theme is to borrow from any cultural item (clothes, colloquialisms, etc.) and use it as if ones self is a collage of everything. The result is that hipsters often look like theyre dressed for a Halloween party and they talk like they are aware of many things but understand very little. Remixing or re-using cultural items of another age are not entirely uncommon. My generation, for example, is known for using the jazz and blues era in our (hip hop) music. The difference, however, is that hipster culture (according to its critics) does not offer anything new and in the absence of providing anything to culture it mocks everyone elses.

        <h2>How Ironic, Mrs. Wampole</h2>
        <p>She believes that hipster culture is the result of our societal proclivity towards irony, a result of the new technological age. Life in the Internet age has undoubtedly helped a certain ironic sensibility to flourish. An ethos can be disseminated quickly and widely through this medium. Our incapacity to deal with the things at hand is evident in our use of, and increasing reliance on, digital technology. Prioritizing what is remote over what is immediate, the virtual over the actual, we are absorbed in the public and private sphere by the little devices that take us elsewhere.
        </p>
        <p>While reading her article I couldnt help but think about <strong>Baudrillards</strong> idea of the world consisting of self-referential signs. The hipster style could be described the same way. In fact, the only thing missing from her biting critique of hipster culture is the lack of any mention of <strong>Baudrillard</strong> as his theories align themselves perfectly with this cultural phenomena, one that no one seems to understand but most people hate.</p>
