        <p>Andre Baudrillard is an interesting theorist and I fear that discussing his work at face value would see me tripping over a number of things that I don't quite understand about his work. However, there was one idea that resonated with an aspect of culture that Ive been following lately: hipsters. Baudrillard's idea of the simulacra, the idea that hyperreality creates a world of self reference is indicative of the hipster movement. Actually, that is exactly what the criticism of hipster-ism has been. For clarity, a hipster is eloquently described by Christy Wampole of the New York Times.
        </p>
        <h2>Wampole-a-Hipster</h2>
        <p>According to Wampole, a hipster is an urban harlequin [who] appropriates outmoded fashions (the mustache, the tiny shorts), mechanisms (fixed-gear bicycles, portable record players) and hobbies (home brewing, playing trombone). He harvests awkwardness and self-consciousness. Before he makes any choice, he has proceeded through several stages of self-scrutiny. The hipster is a scholar of social forms, a student of cool. He studies relentlessly, foraging for what has yet to be found by the mainstream. He is a walking citation; his clothes refer to much more than themselves. He tries to negotiate the age-old problem of individuality, not with concepts, but with material things. This is an opinion shared by a lot of people who have observed and written about hipsters. It is not uncommon to hear people casually clowning a hipster passerby. Ive done it many times myself. </p>
