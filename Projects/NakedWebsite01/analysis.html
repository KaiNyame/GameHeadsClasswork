			For every type of game, there is a corresponding type of gamer. A good game will target a specific demographic of gamer, weather they are Casuals only interested in getting a gold star, or  hyper-competitive Pros looking for another leaderboard to smash. In this current technological climate, many games are finally big (and complex) enough to draw in more than just one or two interest-groups. Games that have competitive gameplay will also have chat-rooms to socialize in, or open worlds to explore, and this makes game development even more complex in order to meet this new standard of player experience. In the past, games have been bound by their rudimentary hardware, inferior processing, and pesky memory limitations. Games like Adventure, Pong and Pitfall are overly simplistic- not intentionally -but since the classics were created during the beginning of the video game era, they had only the technology that was available in the 70’s and 80’s to work with. One game in particular stands out. Designed by Ed Logg and Dona Bailey, produced by Atari and one of the most well known classics, Centipede is notable because despite its antiquated technology, it’s gameplay remains fun and engaging, creating a light-hearted but competitive atmosphere for many gamers, regardless of their gaming style or interests.

			Centipede is known for being one of the first arcade games that reached out to a previously untapped demographic; women. Bailey, one of the developers was female and added  a couple of deliberate features that hadn’t appeared in previous games. She deliberately chose a more soothing pastel color palate as opposed to games like Donkey Kong, or Pac Man. When creating the gameplay concepts and style, Bailey and Logg used both familiar game-mechanics, a couple uniques spins to make their game stand out and have its own flair. Centipede’s fixed shooter style gameplay was very reminiscent of Space Invaders- one of the true original classics. Enemies that fall down from the top of the screen were familiar to many experienced arcade-goers, letting the competition for the ever-coveted high score become quite fierce. The new enemy movement (a basic descending zig-zag pattern) gave just enough variation for veteran gamers to not get over-confident, while also giving newer players a chance to gain expertise and not get shut out with terribly specialized gameplay. To newbs and vets alike, Centipede offered a fun challenge that let everyone try out their skills against each other, despite being at different levels of expertise.
